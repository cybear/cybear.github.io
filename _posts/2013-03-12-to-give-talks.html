<h3>To give talks</h3>
<p>As I had founded the Öresund Frontend Meetup I wanted to give talks in order to learn how to talk, share tools and technologies I believe in and crazy ideas, and of course to earn a little self promotion. I managed to do quite a few:</p>
<h4>Talks (meetup groups)</h4>
<p><a title="Phonegap" href="http://tap5.com/talks/phonegap/#slide1">Phonegap</a> at Öresund Frontend Meetup</p>
<p><a href="http://jsfiddle.net/cybear/wXYnG/">Chess UI using only fonts and CSS3</a> at Öresund Frontend Meetup</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/cybear/HTML5-Color-Clock">1K color clock in HTML5, CSS3 and JS</a> at Öresund Frontend Meetup</p>
<p><a href="http://lanyrd.com/2011/cphjs-october/skgyb/">An interactive HDR viewer using Canvas</a> at CopenhagenJS</p>

<h4>Talks (Universities and Companies)</h4>
<p><strong>HTML5, CSS3, mobile strategies</strong> at IT University of Copenhagen</p>
<p><strong>HTML5, CSS3, mobile strategies</strong> at Malmö University</p>
<p><strong>Phonegap</strong> at Copenhagen Community Day 2011</p>
<p><strong>HTML5, CSS3, mobile strategies</strong>, 4H workshop at Business Academy Copenhagen North</p>

<hr />
<p>Giving talks has taught me a lot about myself and talking to an audience. I will share some of my own lessons, as I think they might be generic.</p>
<h3>Know your topic</h3>
<p>This is obvious, but for my first few talks, I sometimes was not prepared enough to give the same serious impression throughout the whole presentation. Know what you are talking about and, preferrably, read up intensely some days before your actual presentation.</p>
<h3>Use keywords in your slides</h3>
<p>When you have slides with just the right amount of information, both you and your audience benefits. The keywords you write down ensure you don't forget anything important, but also give you enough space to improvise. To the audience, keywords remind them what it is that I am talking about.<br />
Don't use bullets. Don't have long sentences. Use as few words as possible on each slide. Use as many slides as you can - they come for free.</p>
<h3>Rehearse</h3>
<p>For each rehearsal, you always find something to improve. I talked too much about this topic. I forgot to mention that. I could squeeze in a fun story here. Two to three rehearsals make for a dramatically better talk. When you know your talk, you also become much more relaxed. I recommend the following books: Presentation Zen and Slide:ology.</p>
<h3>Relax</h3>
<p>When I'm not relaxed, I tend to assume everyone in my audience already knows what I'm about to talk about. For this reason I talk faster and don't go into details. When I am relaxed, I take my time to explain what is important. I am also much more pleasant to listen to.</p>
<h3>Make bad jokes</h3>
<p>When I'm comfortable enough with my topic, my slides and my rehearsal, I usually want to fire off a few bad jokes. The feedback from the audience usually makes me relaxed.</p>
<h3>(get to) Know your audience</h3>
<p>Ask your audience questions. If I'm going to talk about HDR, a good place to start is to ask "How many people have heard of HDR? How many know what it is? How many have tried it?" When you know the basic knowledge of your group, you don't have to explain too little or too much.</p>
<h3>Obviously, it's also important to have good slides.</h3>
<p>Since 2010, much has happened in both my work life and personal life. Most importantly, I got married and got a son. For this reason, I will not give so many talks for a while. But one day I will be back, more prepared and hungry than ever.</p>
