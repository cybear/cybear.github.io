<p>If you're into CSS, chances are that you already know most<br />
of these brilliant people. I am really happy to have learned from<br />
talks, blog posts and tweets by them. So without further ado, here<br />
are my top 5 most inspiring women in CSS:</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.stubbornella.org/">Nicole Sullivan</a></h3>
<p> blogged and talked about Object-Oriented CSS<br />
(OOCSS) in 2009 (or earlier?) which was possibly the first attempts<br />
at articulating solutions for some of the biggest problems with<br />
CSS. (Nowadays I'm really excited about SMACSS by Jonathan Snook.)<br />
On her site Stubbornella I also first learned about CSS performance<br />
and CSS bad practices. </p>
<h3>Lea Verou</h3>
<p>, CSS Pioneer </p>
<h3>Divya Manian</h3>
<h3>Ana Tudor</h3>
<p>Meagan Fisher</p>
