<p>The Øresund Frontend Meetup today was a success. We had the most attendants ever. After my speech, some interesting discussions spawned. ØFM continues to impress me - our members are of very different background but with passion and much knowledge. If you're living in the Øresund region and are into Frontend, be sure to check out <a title="Øresund Frontend Meetup" href="http://www.meetup.com/Oresund-Frontend/">our meetup page</a>.</p>
