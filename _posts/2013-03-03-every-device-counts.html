<blockquote><em>If it has a web browser, put it to use!</em></p></blockquote>
<p>This has been my motto lately. I had lots of devices lying in drawers, not being used anymore. I stopped playing video games on the PSP since I got my first iPhone. I had a WebOS smartphone only ever used for development and toying around. My Kindle was rarely used as was my iPad. I started thinking, "What a shame."</p>
<p>Here's all these technology enthusiasts like me, buying new smartphones, tablets, gaming devices every year. And so many of the aged devices just lying around, doing nothing. They were replaced by a newer generation, or a different, more modern kind of device.  But there's one thing most of them have in common:</p>
<p>They have a display, some input methods, WiFi and a web browser.</p>
<p><strong>Browser devices</strong>. Awesome.</p>
<p>Following my motto, I've tried to make a generic solution to liberating these old devices. My ambition: It should be as easy as possible for developers to capture HTML5 devices and interact with them. They can be part of a bigger context where it's less important how fast they are or which OS they run. The web is the platform. If it has a browser, it should be put to use.</p>
<h2>Use cases?</h2>
<p>I've started thinking about different cases where this could be useful.<br />
<a href="http://tap5.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/2009-04-01-05.37.57.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-174" alt="flightsim" src="http://tap5.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/2009-04-01-05.37.57-1024x682.jpg" width="595" height="396" /></a></p>
<h3>Flight simulator</h3>
<p>In this case, connected devices get different roles in the game. Have the altimeter, airspeed indicator and magnetic compass on separate physical displays.</p>
<h3>Video player</h3>
<p>Main screen to be controlled by connected devices. As long as the connected device has some form of input controls, it will be possible to get a simple HTML interface for play, pause, volume etc.</p>
<h3><a href="http://tap5.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/example1.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-194" alt="Illustration of an interactive graffiti wall" src="http://tap5.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/example1-1024x724.png" width="595" height="420" /></a></h3>
<h3>Graffiti wall</h3>
<p>Participants can use their smartphones to draw on an electronic graffiti wall.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, I'm sure I still haven't figured out the best use case yet. There should be tons of interesting applications using this recipe. We know HTML5. <strong>What's to stop us from making awesome multi-device apps?</strong></p>
<p>Your comments are welcome.</p>
