<p><em>Your "first screen" is always the one in your pocket. But sometimes you will rather use something else before that.</em></p>
<h2>Turn on the friggin' lamp</h2>
<p>You're at a friend's super modern house and you want to turn on a lamp. Get ready to spend some serious tinker time - because your friend has installed a new home automation system! Grab your phone and install an app. Connect to your friend's WiFi. Type in some password to get access to their home automation system. Now push the button on your phone.</p>
<p><strong>This UX sucks</strong>. It's a serious degradation from the physical light switches. Think about it! Light switches are always the same place, always connected, don't need software updates and they <strong>never run out of battery</strong>.</p>
<p>So how can we match that? How about having a device devoted to a specific purpose! Imagine that your friend has a remote control on their wall where you would expect the normal lamp switch to be. Always on, it's always showing the same menu.</p>
<p>If you like the idea, check out what hardware I've found.</p>
<h2>Best hardware for "remote controls"</h2>
<p>To me, e-readers are the best IoT remote controls. <strong>Their screen only consumes power when changing</strong>. They come with wi-fi and touch screen. Usually they have a pretty modern web browser pre-installed. <strong>Put one on the wall of every room in your home.</strong></p>
<h2>Nook Simple Touch</h2>
<p>It's extremely cheap - £29 in the UK!</p>
<p>It's super easy to <a href="http://tap5.com/blog/2013/12/your-own-29-e-paper-browser-kiosk/">make into a Kiosk Browser that displays the GUI of your choice</a>.</p>
<p>By spending perhaps one hour, you will have made the device automatically boot into the web browser, full screen, displaying the web page of your choice. In this case being the menu for your friend's light switches. But really, why not also a jukebox menu?</p>

<h3>PS: HTML wins</h3>
<p>Thanks to the coming of smartphones, we learnt how to build web pages that can be run on every device with a screen. When we make menus for IoT devices, those will be possible to put on devoted devices like the converted e-reader in this example.</p>
