<p><a href="http://tap5.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/mah-logo.gif"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-35" title="mah-logo" src="http://tap5.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/mah-logo.gif" alt="" width="102" height="120" /></a>On Wednesday February 16th, I did a presentation at Malmö Högskola on the topic of HTML5, CSS3 and Phonegap. Most attendees were students from the cool education "<a href="http://www.edu.mah.se/TGMPP/">Media production and process design</a>". Some of these students are going to be doing some hands-on web development in the future, but I am sure that almost all are going to be involved in web and mobile web strategies at some point. I tried to find a good balance between tech talk and mobile web strategies like progressive enhancement, graceful degradation, feature and cost comparison between native apps and Phonegap apps. We ended the session with a discussion about copying code on the Internet and different open source licenses.</p>
