<p><a href="http://tap5.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0579.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-357" src="http://tap5.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0579-1024x514.jpg" alt="Raspberry Pi DSI Touch Screen Prototype" width="625" height="313" /></a>Late February this year, <a href="http://raspi.tv/2014/raspberry-pi-official-7-inch-dsi-prototype-preview">RasPi.tv published some information</a> about the upcoming official Raspberry Pi DSI touch screen.</p>
<p>Here's some specs:</p>
<p>* 10 point capacitive touch<br />
* 7 inch LCD<br />
* DSI connector<br />
* 800 x 480 pixels</p>
<p>It sounds like we can expect simultaneous output on both the touch screen and over HDMI.</p>
<hr />
<p>Given the premise that we have two screens I started imagining how software could make use of it.</p>
<p>• Presentation software - speaker's notes and navigation on touch screen, slides on HDMI<br />
• XBMC - browse, preview, playback controls on touch screen, movie on. HDMI</p>
<p>If the two-screen setup takes off in the Raspberry Pi community, I think we are going to see a lot of software to work with 2 screens.</p>
<p>An idea is to start implementing 2-screen app interfaces in HTML. This way they can be made available to smartphones as well. In many situations I'd love it if I could use a dedicated screen (Pi DSI screen) and my smartphone interchangably.</p>
