<p>I've been tinkering around with the Nook Simple Touch to see if I can make it into a browser kiosk. It's an e-reader from Barnes &amp; Noble similar to the Kindle, but it's very cheap; on offer now <a href="http://www.barnesandnoble.com/p/nook-simple-touch-barnes-noble/1102344735">in the US for $59</a> and in the <a href="http://www.nook.com/gb/tablets/nook-simple-touch">UK for £29</a>! It runs Android and you can pretty easily jailbreak it.<br />
Turns out it's very easy to turn it into your own browser kiosk!</p>

<h2>What can I do with it?</h2>
<p>The first thing that pops to my mind is single-purpose, fixed home gadgets.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Wall clock</strong>: Show the time, weather and what our calendars show for today.</li>
<li><strong>Home Automation Remote</strong>: Put it on the wall next to the light switches. Show controls for wireless lights, music and volume etc.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Advantages</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Everything in one device</strong>: Touch display, web browser, WiFi</li>
<li><strong>Thin product</strong> that easily can be mounted to a wall</li>
<li><strong>Low power</strong> consumption because of E-ink display (however WiFi does drain it over a day or so)</li>
<li>Good exercise in <strong>UI constraints</strong> - monochrome display with slow refresh rate</li>
</ul>
<h2>Let's do it!</h2>
<h3>Root the Nook</h3>
<p>Follow the instructions here: <a href="http://www.babblingengineer.com/how-to/how-i-turned-my-nook-into-an-e-reader-monster/">http://www.babblingengineer.com/how-to/how-i-turned-my-nook-into-an-e-reader-monster/</a></p>
<h4>Install the browser kiosk</h4>
<p>On your computer:<br />
Install Phonegap: npm install -g phonegap<br />
Make a Phonegap app:<br />
phonegap create nook-kiosk<br />
Add your web page to the www/ folder or point the project to your website<br />
Build with Android as target platform: phonegap run android<br />
After a short while, your app is ready.<br />
Open the URL to your APK file in your Nook browser. You will be asked if you want to install it. Do it!</p>
<h3>Disable sleep</h3>
<p>adb shell<br />
sqlite3 /data/data/com.android.providers.settings/databases/settings.db<br />
update system set value='-1' where name='screen_off_timeout';</p>
<p>Now you can have an awesome touch-based remote for your home automation system - have it always display the menu and put it up on the wall together with the light switches :-)</p>
<h3>Questions I still haven't solved</h3>
<ul>
<li>Can we use the physical side buttons? (There's two on the left side and two on the right)</li>
<li>Can we disable the home button?</li>
<li>How to make the kiosk app autostart? As of now, I've used an app from the Kindle App Store to do it for me.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Ideas?</h3>
<p>Does this give you ideas? Let me know in the comments!</p>
