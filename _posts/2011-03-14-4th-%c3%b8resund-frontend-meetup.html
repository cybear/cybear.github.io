<p>Tonight, we had the fourth ever <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Oresund-Frontend/">Øresund Frontend Meetup</a>. We didn't have an agenda and we were only a handful of people, but it was "hyggeligt". We had a little show and tell; <a href="http://twitter.com/trogels">Troels Lenda</a> showed a demo with inline SVG combined with CSS3. I showed my 1K HTML5 Colour Clock with dynamic favicon, and a test I've been playing with using the "text blur" CSS3 hack.</p>
<p>For the next meetup, we agreed that we should come up with some concept that we can hack on together.</p>
<p>If you haven't checked Øresund Frontend Meetup out, <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Oresund-Frontend/">you should</a>! It's fun and free.</p>
