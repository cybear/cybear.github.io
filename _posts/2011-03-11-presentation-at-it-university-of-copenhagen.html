<p>Yesterday, I made a presentation on HTML5, CSS3 and Phonegap at IT University of Copenhagen. The audience is attending the course "Dynamic Web Design" has a mixed experience with regards to web development - all know a bit of HTML, CSS and PHP, some also have experience from Java development or similar. During the presentation there were many questions, which I always appreciate. One question was in regards to the new Local Storage in HTML5: We are now enforced by law to inform the user about cookies, do the same rules apply about HTML5 databases?</p>
<p>On this topic I wanted to share this pun: <a href="http://t5.lv/ca">EU “Cookies” Directive. Interactive guide to 25th May and what it means for you</a></p>
