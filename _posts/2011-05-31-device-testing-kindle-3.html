<p>I got my hands on a Kindle 3 just recently. It's a cute device which, to my surprise, packs a Mobile Webkit. This is good news! I decided to try out one of my HTML5/CSS3 experiments, "HTML5 Chess". </p>
<p><a href="http://tap5.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/kindle3-chess.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-90" title="kindle3-chess" src="http://tap5.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/kindle3-chess-764x1024.jpg" alt="" width="595" height="797" /></a></p>
<p>It works! Not only does it render correctly, but it is also possible to navigate inbetween the different pieces using the little 5-way controller.</p>
