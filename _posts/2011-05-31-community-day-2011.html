Around 400 people were attending the three-track conference.</p>
<p>I made an introductory talk on Phonegap. Earlier Phonegap presentations I've made were missing a personal story and hands-on example, so I incorporated that into this one. My <a href="https://github.com/cybear/HTML5-Color-Clock">HTML5 Color Clock (github)</a> was the example code, check it out.</p>
<p>The slides are available on Slideshare: <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/superbjorn/phonegap-cd11">Phonegap introduction, Community Day 2011</a></p>
<p>The audience asked many questions, which is always a success measurement for me. I enjoyed several of the other talks and am looking forward to next year's Community Day!</p>
