<p>In November 2010, I found out that my employer at the time had to cut down on the staff. I was going to be one of the people leaving. It took me a few weeks before I got to my first job interview and that gave me time to think my situation through.</p>
<h3>No academic degree and a small network? Good luck...</h3>
<p>Most job postings in Copenhagen at the time preferred applicants with an academic degree. Like most frontend developers, I don't have an academic degree. I also don't have any frontend developer certificates. (I don't even think they exist.) As a foreigner in my second Danish job, I did not know that many people in my business. Many of the people I knew didn't know exactly what I did and how good I was at it. Those who did were few and did not have job recommendations at the time.</p>
<p>I thought to myself; "Am I the only unknown frontend developer in the area?",<br />
"How can I show people what I know?",<br />
"How can I learn more?"</p>
<p>I decided to start a frontend meetup, and to start giving talks.</p>
<h3>Why meetup?</h3>
<p>The idea of a frontend meetup group was to get to know more frontend developers and learn from them. I was also hoping that my skills would show, on both a personal and a technical level, enough that people in and around the meetup group would consider me when their company was looking for a new frontend developer. I learned sooner than later that the job matching door swings both ways.</p>
<p><a href="http://onereason.eu/#balazs">Balázs Suhajda</a> was a meetup participant since day one. If I remember correctly, he told me about a job at Agnitio as a frontend developer with Javascript, HTML5 and CSS3 for the iPad. He was a consultant there, and the guy juging my technical level at my job interview just a few weeks later. I ended up getting the job because I popped up my iPad during the interview and showed a working prototype of a Scrabble clone that I had built. And just a month later, we needed to recruit more people. All of a sudden, I was looking in the meetup group for more talented people. Stefan Liden of the meetup group was our top candidate and was hired as a frontend developer then, and he is now head of their Labs department.</p>
<h3>Enter Öresund Frontend Meetup</h3>
<p>And so I founded Öresund Frontend Meetup on the meetup.com site, and people actually signed up! We had our first meetup at my friend Adam's place, and from then on usually at Valtech.</p>
